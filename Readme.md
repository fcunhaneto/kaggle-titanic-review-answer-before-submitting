# Kaggle Titanic review your answer before submitting

I created this simple notebook to test my answers from the Kaggle Titanic contest on my own PC.

If you want to use it, just adjust the line below to read your answer, remembering the answer\
must be in the same submission model for Kaggle.

Important: Do not change the name of the variable.

```Python
df2 = pd.read_csv('datasets/logistic-regression.csv')
```

Once this is done, just run the notebook.
